# Dotfiles Manager
A tool to manage installation of dotfiles. Handy for setting up raspberry pi's.

## Installation
Run the following command (but only if you're me... if not, read the install script to see what's going on):
`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shanecb/Dotfiles-Manager/master/install.sh | bash`
